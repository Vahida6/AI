Here we created deep learning model using both Gradient descent and ADAM optimizers with different hyperparameter values.The following inference has been obtained:

The best optimizer for this Titanic data set would be the SGD and the learning rate is 0.1 with only 50 epochs we obtained the** 81% accuracy** both in train and test data set.
